<font size="4">"Matthew is one of the most versatile guitarists I have had the pleasure of performing with. He moves easily between fingerpicking a steel string or classical to wailing on his electric or steel guitar. He is incredibly creative in his arranging and improvisations. He is a joy to perform with."</font>
